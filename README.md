Welcome to my React-based quiz app! This project provides an interactive platform for users to test their knowledge on a variety of subjects, with features such as multiple choice questions, score tracking, and time limits. The app was built using React, allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface, as well as efficient data management using React's state and props.

The quiz app consists of a simple and intuitive user interface, which guides the user through the quiz-taking process. The app is highly customizable, allowing for the creation of quizzes on a variety of subjects, with the ability to add or remove questions and adjust time limits as needed.

In addition to the quiz-taking functionality, this app also tracks the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz. The user can review their answers and see the correct answers for any questions they missed, making it a great learning tool as well.

This project is open source and contributions are always welcome. Please refer to the README file for instructions on how to install and use the app. Thank you for checking out my quiz app!
